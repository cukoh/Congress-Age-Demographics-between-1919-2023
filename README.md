# Data Used

**Data** - Congress Demographic Data with over 29000 rows from the year 1910 to 2023.

**Data Cleaning and Analysis** - MySQL

**Data Visualization** - PowerBI

**Generations from the Dataset**

The generations in the dataset are defined as follows:

* Gilded (1822-1842) 
* Progressive (1843-1859) 
* Missionary (1860-1882) 
* Lost (1883-1900) 
* Greatest (1901-1927) 
* Silent (1928-1945) 
* Baby boomer (1946-1964) 
* Generation X (1965-1980) 
* Millennial (1981-1996) 
* Generation Z (1997-2012)

# Questions
1. How many total politicians are in each political party?
2. Which generational demographic has had the largest total presence in Congress?
3. What is the party distribution amongst the generations?
4. What is the most common age range of politicians in Congress?
5. Average age of politicians within the generations
6. What is the generational dominance throughout the decades?
7. What is the trend in average politician age throughout time?

# Summary of Findings
*  There have been more democratic representatives than republican representatives in Congress
*  Of all the generations listed within this dataset, the Greatest Generation (1901-1927) has had the greatest presence in Congress, followed by the Silent Generation (1928-1945). On the contrary, the Gilded Generation (1822-1842) had the smallest presence, followed by the Millennials (1981-1996).
*  Cohorts from the Greatest, Lost, Missionary, and Millennial Generations lean Democrat, while cohorts from Generation X, Lost, Boomer, and Progressive Generations lean Republican.
*   The most common age range for a congressional representative is between 50-59.
*   The youngest representative in the dataset was 26 years old. The oldest was 91 years old.
*   The Greatest Generation had three decades of congressional dominance (1950-1970). The Baby Boomers have continued to be the dominant generation in Congress since the 2000s.
*   It appears that Generation X has a disproportionately small presence in Congress, despite the fact that representatives from that cohort have been elected into Congress since the 1990s.
*   Over the course of a century, it appears that the average politician in Congress has gotten older with time.

# Limitations
* The sample sizes for some generational cohorts were limited, namely the Gilded, Progressive, and Millennial Generations.
